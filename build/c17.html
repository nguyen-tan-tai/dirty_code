        ### C1: Inappropriate Information
        Reserve comments for technical notes referring to code and design.

        Write good code. Write comments when good code is not enough, or that you had to write some sort of bad code for any reason whatsoever.
        In a perfect world, these developers would be right.
        If you name your variables properly, separate your code into multiple easily understandable functions and classes, and write pretty good code overall then indeed you will drastically reduce the amount of comments needed.
        BUT...
        ...coding is never that simple.

        Even great programmers often end up having to write some sort of ugly / unintuitive code to fix an obscure bug that is the result of a design decision made years ago.
        There's not a single senior developer who has never felt like they just wrote a shitty hack for a bug because because the only other way to fix it was to rewrite the entire feature from scratch.
        The issue come from the ones who don't bother to explain why they had to do it this way while justifying it by saying that "good code does not need comments".
        It takes only 5 minutes to explain why you made this decision in the code, and it will save hours of work for the developer who will need to look at it after 2 years when a new bug is introduced.

        ### C2: Obsolete Comment
        Update or delete obsolete comments.

        Comments are a code smell. Obsolete comments are a real danger and nobody maintains what can't be executed.

        ```
            void Widget::displayPlugin(Unit* unit) {
                // TODO the Plugin will be modified soon, so I don't implement this right now
                if (!isVisible) {
                    // hide all widgets
                    return;
                }
            }
        ```

        ```
            void Widget::displayPlugin(Unit* unit) {
